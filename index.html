        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>

        <p>At Robin's Machined Customs we approach every new project the same way; and that is to ensure your idea is crafted to the highest possible quality each time.</p>
        <p>We have over $1 million worth of high-tech, calibrated machinery that puts out only the most precise products for our customers. We work with contracts from the military, local auto shops, out-of-state automotive companies, and our cherished local customers.</p>
        <p>I don't want any of our potential new customers to ever feel intimidated by a new project or an idea that they have, so even if you're not sure what you're looking for, we can guide you from the very beginning!</p>
        
        <h2>Happy Accident</h2>

        <p>I began a love of machining parts when I enlisted into the Navy in January, 2010.
        <br>I had no idea that the machinist trade even existed, and I was given this job as a "Needs of the Navy" billet!
        <br>Turns out, that was the best thing that ever happened to me! 
        <br>So in 2024, I decided to create my own company to showcase what this amazing trade is capable of.
        <br>It's also a blessing to see other women get encouraged to pursue a career in the trades. </p>
        <p>We're hiring so feel free to <a href="contact.html" target="_self">give us an email or call</a> from 7AM - 4PM, Monday through Friday!</p>
