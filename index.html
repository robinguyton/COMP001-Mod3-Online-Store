          <h2>Happy Accident</h2>
        <p>I began a love of machining parts when I enlisted into the Navy in January, 2010.
        <br>I had no idea that the machinist trade even existed, and I was given this job as a "Needs of the Navy" billet!
        <br>Turns out, that was the best thing that ever happened to me! 
        <br>So in 2024, I decided to create my own company to showcase what this amazing trade is capable of.
        <br>It's also a blessing to see other women get encouraged to pursue a career in the trades. </p>
        <p>We're hiring so feel free to <a href="contact.html" target="_self">give us an email or call</a> from 7AM - 4PM, Monday through Friday!</p>
