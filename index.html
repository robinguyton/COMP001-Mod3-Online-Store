    <p>I began a love of machining parts when I enlisted into the Navy in January, 2010.
        <br>I had no idea that the machinist trade even existed, and I was given this job as a "Needs of the Navy" billet!
        <br>Turns out, that was the best thing that ever happened to me! So in 2024, I decided to create my own company.
        <br>Please take a look around and our team of talented machinists will work with you to bring your ideas to life!
