        <img src="images/brgav.jpeg" alt="photo of brass gavel" height="500" width="750">
        <p>This is one of my most proud creations. I machined this brass gavel for my CMC for Chief Season in 2011
        <br>It has aluminum rings which were given a tight press fit to go onto the brass.
        <br>He returned this gavel to me after Chief Season for me to clean it up. I didn't expect him to actually use it!</p>
